# Code Minds

Code Minds is a software development academy created as a response to the declining quality of the education that is given in universities as they fail to create professional developers updated with the relevant skills for today's industry. We focus our courses on not only giving the strong foundation other entities are lacking but also in teaching individuals how jobs, salaries, negotiations and recruiting works in order to achieve the ultimate goal of why they pay for an education: be able to make money to provide for themselves and their families.

This is a collection of repositories of various sample projects used in the courses as well as open source tools that certified students can contribute to in order to hone the skills learned in the academy.
